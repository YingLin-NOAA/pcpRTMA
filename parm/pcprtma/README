  grib2_pcprtma_g184  - ConUS RTMA (2.5km grid) (was grib2_hrestmapcp_ndfd.184)

2019/08/29, for v2.8.0
  Changed PDT(10) from 1 to 102 ('0 m above mean sea level' as in the
  original MRMS file, because when I change it to 'surface' via 
  "wgrib2 -set_lev surface" it messes up the "PRODUCT TEMPLATE 4. 8:" (degrib2)
  big time.
  Changed PDT(14) - scale factor - from 0 to 1, because MRMS has '1' for this.
